##Getting started

A few things you have to take in consideration before using Trash Walk - Server

After cloning the repo you'll have to :

### Install global and local dependancies:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/): `brew install node`
* [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install`
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

### Migrate and connect Postgres database

Install PostGres and PostGis on your machine:

```bash
brew install postgres
brew install postgis
```

Access postgres command line on the default database postgres:

```bash
psql postgres
```

You should see on your bash a screen like this:

```bash
psql (10.3)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

Now create a new database for the current user and connect it:

```bash
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE trashwalk;
postgres=# \c trashwalk;
```

The result will be:

```bash
You are now connected to database "trashwalk" as user <user-name>.
trashwalk=#
```

Now set a password for the current user:

```bash
trashwalk=# ALTER USER <user_name> WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';
```

Finally, create the extension for PostGis:

```bash
trashwalk=# CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

Always remember the semicolon or the syntax will not work.

Now your database setup is finished and you are ready to connect it with the server. 

In order to do this, create an **.env** file in the root server folder with this structure:

```plain
DB_USER=<user-name>
DB_PASS=<password>
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=<db-name>
```

You also can change the port or database name on postgres configuration database.

Finally, migrate the database on your local machine:

```bash 
cd trash-walk-backend
node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
```
## Usage

Start the server:

`npm start`
